# MD_Joystick 

Library to encapsulate a Gamepad/Joystick Shield.

This library implements a few functions to return switch presses and analog joystick value to the user 
application in a consistent manner. The hardware analog and digital pins are defined by the hardware 
and can be changed in the library header file.
